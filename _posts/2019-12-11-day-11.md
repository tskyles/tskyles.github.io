Today I spent my day working on the team challenge. I got the homepage structured in html and began working on the css components.
The link to my PR is https://github.com/tskyles/Design-Challenge-301-401/pull/1
I got to re-inforce html and in particular using emmet shortcuts. I also reinforced css styling.
Tomorrow I will be continuing to work on that project.
