Today I did a little bit of modification to my reddit bot. I added in a regex check and deployed it to heroku.https://github.com/tskyles/smile-bot/commit/03c4898dc6ab01f1eac91b3bad6e3f04e1b82680

 I also went through and began to test out using mongodb and made some very basic authenication. Tomorrow I plan to work on another user auth project using mongodb, express, react, and node.
