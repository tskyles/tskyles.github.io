Today I started work on the python crash course. I got my environment all set up and started working through the tutorial; https://github.com/tskyles/python-crash-course/commits/master. I also watched a FCC video on creating a MERN stack application. I learned about basic python syntax and began to put it to use. I also reinforced my knowledge on using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. Tomorrow I plan to continue to work on the python tutorial.
