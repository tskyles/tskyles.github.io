Today I continued reading and practicing working with react native. I set up another android app workspace and began playing with creating another app. I integrated react navigation into my app and worked on developing multiple pages/routes. I also looked at the weekly project and challenge and began planning some of that work. Tomorrow I will continue working on my app, as well as beginning working on the weekly work.

Today I learned about using React Navigation within react native.
