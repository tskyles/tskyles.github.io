Today I got my salmon cookies project refactored using jquery. I also did a lot of reading up on bootstrap in preparation for refactoring my salmon cookies using bootstrap as my framework. On top of that I worked on my calculator project a little bit as well.

Today i reinforced my knowledge of jquery and learned a bit on bootstrap. Tomorrow I plan to use that bootstrap knowledge for the refactoring. I also plan to dive into creating an express server for a side project.
